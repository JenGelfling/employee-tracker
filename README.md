# Employee tracker

For this assignment, I created an application that allows a user to track employees, departments, and roles using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. It allows a user to view all departments, roles, and employees. It also allows a user to create new departmetns, roles, and employees, as well as updating an employee role and manager.
